Topic: Patient Information and Record Management System

      Patient information and respecting their privacy are a key and a major component of our application. Our application collects personal information such as a patient’s medical history. It provides information about the patient’s pre-existing conditions or history of treatments the individual might have undergone, which is crucial for the doctors to know to provide appropriate care. Another part of the application allows health care providers to have quick and easy access to health information. The app provides the most up to date information to the hospitals upon requests. After patients’ recovery, related health information will be updated for future use as well. Furthermore, the app will uphold the confidentiality of patient information as only authorized individuals will have access to the information and non-essential information will be discarded as per protocols. 
      
      The functionality of the application includes entering, editing, and discarding a patient's personal information. The information must be as detailed as possible to provide appropriate and patient-centered service for each patient. The information collected will contain: first name, last name, address (street name, city, province, country, postal code), height, weight, date of birth, gender, blood type and contact information (phone number, e-mail address, emergency contact). In addition to that, each patient will be assigned to a unique identifier for easier information sharing and retrieval. Along with that, a patient’s medical record will be updated each time when they encounter any health care providers. The record will contain information on pre-existing conditions, past medical history, current treatments and medication, family’s health history, patient’s lifestyle, and health care provider’s comments or recommendations.
